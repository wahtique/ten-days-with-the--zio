# 10 days with the ZIO

My own take on following  "10 days with the ZIO" from Andrea on DEV. The first article can be found here : https://dev.to/gurghet/10-days-with-the-zio-1-10-1oom
The oiginal articles were written in Scala 2.12 and ZIO 1.0.3, but I will strive to reimplement this tutorial using Scala 3 and ZIO 2.

## Dependencies 

- mill as build tool
- Scala 3
